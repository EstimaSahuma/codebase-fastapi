## Project Overview

This is a codebase that I use to build the backend of my projects (API and MicroService).

## Applied Concepts

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) : is a versatile, high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has gained popularity across a wide range of domains due to its ease of use, extensive libraries, and strong community support.
- [FastApi](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) : is a modern, high-performance, and easy-to-use web framework for building APIs with Python. It is designed to provide rapid development without sacrificing performance, making it an excellent choice for creating RESTful APIs, web services, and microservices.
- [Clean Architeture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) : is a software design philosophy that emphasizes the separation of concerns, maintainability, and testability of a software application. It was introduced by Robert C. Martin, also known as Uncle Bob. The primary goal of Clean Architecture is to create a system that is independent of external details like frameworks, databases, and UI components, making the core business logic more stable and reusable.
- [SOLID](https://realpython.com/courses/solid-principles-python/) : is an acronym that represents five design principles aimed at creating maintainable and extensible software systems. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin and are widely adopted in software development to improve code quality, readability, and maintainability.
- [TDD](https://realpython.com/tdd-python/) : is a software development approach where tests are written before the actual code is implemented. It follows a cycle of writing a failing test, implementing the code to make the test pass, and then refactoring the code while ensuring that the test still passes. TDD aims to improve code quality, maintainability, and reliability by promoting a clear understanding of requirements and early identification of defects.
- [SqlAlquemy](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/) : is a powerful and widely-used Python library that provides a set of tools for working with relational databases. It's an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library that simplifies database operations by allowing you to work with database tables and records as Python objects, while also providing a SQL expression language for more complex queries.
- [OAuth2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) : is an authorization framework that allows applications to securely access resources on behalf of a user. It is widely used for granting third-party applications limited access to a user's protected resources without exposing their credentials. OAuth2 defines a set of roles, grant types, and endpoints that enable secure authentication and authorization flows.
